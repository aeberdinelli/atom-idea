# Atom Idea
This is a package to convert atom in a small PHP IDE.
It's just getting started so you shouldn't expect magic, it will capture every piece of documentation written in the format:

```
/**
 * Description of the function
 *
 * @param String text Description of the 'text' parameter
 * @return boolean Description of the return
 */

function something($text)
{
    return true;
}
```

##### Note:
This is my first package for atom, and I have almost zero experience with its environment, so it may have weird bugs.
